    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>At Gulabi, we know that distance from home doesn't have to mean distance from your culture. Our charming little business came as an extension of a loving tradition, a dream to celebrate occasions true to home, anywhere in the world.</p>
    <p>Gulabi is led by a passionate woman, who realized that her loved ones who had moved away were missing out on the joys of wearing their culture. She began preparing and sending intricate Pakistani clothes to her beloved ones, abroad. These were not just garments; but a heartfelt gift from her embellishing their moments of celebration with sheer joy - a piece of home. </p>

   <p>And thus the word of mouth quickly spread and Gulabi was born. Here, each dress is crafted with meticulous care, carrying within it the essance of shared traditions to all corners of the world. Gulabi means pink in Urdu - it is a name inspired by the radiant, rosy cheeks that lit up in delight upon recieving these parcels of love.</p>
